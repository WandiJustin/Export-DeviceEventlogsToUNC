# Export-DeviceEventlogsToUNC

I was tasked with creating a powershell script with the following expectations:

- ðŸŒ± Create an array to add specific devices to access the desired eventlogs 
- ðŸ“« Export these eventlogs to a local directory 
- ðŸ‘€ Move the exported eventlogs to a UNC path
- ðŸ‘» Avoid multi-hopping (http://disq.us/t/3p6t28f) 
- ðŸ’ª Can be easily changed to advocate to most use-cases. 

The complete powershell script is in this repository.
